            In this case, the 25 pictures featured on Band’s About Us page are worth much more than the 170 actual words you’ll read on the page.

            Who doesn’t love a good bio?
            
            Especially one that starts with “I was born in good ol’ Madison, Wisconsin. The son of a Librarian and a Researcher.”
            
            It also goes on to tell you how he and his family survived Hurricane Andrew and how his sister was born that night.
            
            Who is this guy?

           <p> Doomtree About Us pageScreenshot from DoomTree, January 2022
            DoomTree’s page starts off as a coming-of-age story about how “a mess of friends” built the record label that made them a household name in Minneapolis.
            
            However, it’s really the audio and the visuals that got us hooked.
            
            Why tell, when you can show, right?
            
            Explore their About Us page to meet the crew, listen to their songs, and get the latest news.
